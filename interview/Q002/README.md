# Determining if All Characters in a String Are Unique

## Problem Description

Please implement an algorithm to determine if all characters in a given string are **unique**. It is required that **no additional storage structures are allowed**. Given a string, return a boolean value: `true` implies all characters are unique, and `false` indicates there are duplicate characters. It's guaranteed that characters in the string are **ASCII characters**. The length of the string is less than or equal to **3000**.

## Solution Approach

There are a few key points here. The first one is about ASCII characters. There are a total of 256 ASCII characters, of which 128 are commonly used and can be typed on a keyboard. Characters after 128 are not typically found on standard keyboards.

The emphasis is on all characters being unique, meaning there are no duplicates in the string. Additionally, the use of extra storage structures is not allowed, and the string's length is up to 3000.

If additional storage was permitted, this problem would be straightforward. If not, it can be achieved using built-in methods in Golang.
