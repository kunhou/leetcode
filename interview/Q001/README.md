# Alternating Printing of Numbers and Letters

## Problem Description

Use two goroutines to alternately print a sequence: one goroutine prints numbers, and the other prints letters. The final result should look like:

```

```

## Solution Approach

The problem is straightforward. Use channels to control the printing progression. Employ two channels to control the print sequence of numbers and letters respectively. Once the numbers are printed, signal through a channel to notify the letter printing. Once letters are printed, signal back for the numbers, and continue this loop.
